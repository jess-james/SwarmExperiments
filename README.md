# SwarmExperiments
*Experiments using a 'Swarm' learner on synthetic and climate data.*

Swarm learner based on the algorithm defined in ['Online Multitask Learning with Long-Term Memory'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07055) and  performance is compared to the Fixed- and Variable-Share learners defined by [Bosquet and Warmuth](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bousquet02b/bousquet02b.pdf).

Experiments conducted on synthetic data (in synthetic_experiments.py) and on Global Circulation models (in ta_experiments.py). GCMs sourced from the ‘Climate of the 20th Century Experiment’ (20C3M) for IPCC and can be accessed at https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip3/. Learners trained on Climate Data from 1980-2000, and formatted for experiments in import_data.py.
